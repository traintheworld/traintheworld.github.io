                            tools for resilience educators – Edu2Help Project</h2>
                    </div>
                    Linguistic diversity presents a key challenge in digital educational settings. In the context of
                    resilience pedagogy, comprehensibility is a crucial factor for safety, participation, and
                    psychosocial stability.
                    Modern AI translation systems can provide support by reducing language barriers and
                    facilitating multilingual webinars. The European Framework for the Digital Competence of
                    Educators ( DigCompEdu ) emphasizes the targeted use of digital tools to promote
                    inclusion.

                    The Didactic Manual was developed as part of the Erasmus+ project Edu2Help . The
                    project focuses on the training of resilience educators who work with vulnerable target
                    groups in various European contexts. These include, for example, people with refugee
                    and migration experience, individuals in psychosocially challenging life situations, the
                    long-term unemployed, the chronically ill, people in rehabilitation, and volunteers in the
                    education and social sectors.
