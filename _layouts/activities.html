                        <h2>Peer Learning – Edu2Help Project</h2> October 2024
                    </div>
                    <p>As part of the Erasmus+ project Edu2Help, a peer-learning activity took place in Cyprus with our
                        Cypriot partner from 5
                        to 15 October 2024. The Erasmus+ project Edu2Help aims to support women in challenging
                        psychological situations by
                        training resilience educators. A key focus of the project is the use of AI-supported
                        simultaneous interpretation tools
                        for multilingual webinars in counselling contexts, in order to reduce language barriers and
                        enable inclusive
                        communication. This dissemination activity provides a comprehensive overview of the insights
                        gained from the project,
                        with a particular focus on the challenges and successes of the AI tools.</p>

                    <h2>Reality Check – Edu2Help Project</h2> November
                    2024
                </div>
                <p>In November 2024, Susanne Leitner, International Vice President for Health and Social Affairs
                    of
                    the European Union of
                    Women (EUW) and member of the Austrian Section of EUW, conducted a series of AI training
                    sessions within the Erasmus+
                    project Edu2Help.</p>
                <p>The training introduced EUW members from several national sections to the use of AI-assisted
                    simultaneous translation
                    tools for organising and hosting digital multilingual webinars.
                    Over four interactive sessions, participants were guided through a digital onboarding
                    process
                    and engaged in hands-on
                    practice with artificial intelligence applications and chatbots, exploring how these tools
                    can
                    enhance communication and
                    collaboration across multiple languages.</p>
                <p>The training highlighted how AI can promote inclusion, accessibility, and cooperation among
                    professionals in health,
                    social affairs, and education.</p>
                <p>Participants expressed strong interest and enthusiasm for integrating AI-based multilingual
                    approaches into their future
                    professional and educational activities.</p>

                    <h2>Peer Learning – Edu2Help Project</h2> October
                    2025
                </div>
                <p>In October 2025, a Peer Learning session was held within the Erasmus+ project Edu2Help, led
                    by
                    Susanne Leitner,
                    International Vice President for Health and Social Affairs of the European Union of Women
                    (EUW)
                    and member of the
                    Austrian Section of EUW.</p>
                <p>Building on the AI training conducted in 2024, this Peer Learning activity brought together
                    members of the European
                    Union of Women (EUW) from various national sections to further develop their ability to
                    conduct
                    digital multilingual
                    webinars using AI-assisted simultaneous translation tools.
                    Participants engaged in collaborative exercises, sharing experiences and experimenting with
                    inclusive communication
                    methods for multilingual learning environments.</p>
                <p>The session emphasised peer exchange, reflective practice, and mutual learning, demonstrating
                    how
                    Artificial
                    Intelligence can support accessibility, intercultural understanding, and digital innovation
                    in
                    adult education.
                    Through this activity, EUW members strengthened their digital readiness, pedagogical
                    confidence,
                    and collaborative
                    resilience, contributing to the overall goal of the Edu2Help project — empowering resilience
                    educators across Europe to
                    design and deliver inclusive, AI-supported learning experiences.</p>
